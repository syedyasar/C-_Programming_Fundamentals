1) int   a = 25;    --->  Constructor  is  not  executed  becoz  it  is  variable  initialization

2) int   b[] = {10 , 20 , 30 , 40};   --->   Constructor  is  not  executed  becoz  it  is  array  initialization

3) int  *p = &a;  --->  Constructor  is  not  executed  becoz  it  is  pointer   initialization

4) Date  c(15 , 8 , 1947);  --->  Constructor  is  executed  becoz  it  is  object  initialization  and  Error  when  Date
						class  does  not  contain  3-parameter   constructor

Conclusion  :  Constructor  is  only  for  object  initialization  but  not  for  variable  and    array  initialization
