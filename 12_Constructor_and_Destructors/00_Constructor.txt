Constructor
-------------------
1) It  is  a  special   member  function  of  the  class.

2) It  is  used  to  initialize  data  members   of  the  object  i.e.  object  initialization

3) It  is  automatically  executed  as  soon  as  object  is  created.

4) Function   is  not  executed   unless  it  is  called   but  constructor  is    automatically   executed  as  soon  as
    object  is  created

Rules
----------
1) Name  of  the  constructor   is  same  as  classname.
    Eg :  If  classname  is  Date,  constructor  name  is  also  Date

2) It  has  no  return  type,  not  even  void

3) It  can  not  contain  return  statement.

4) It  may  or  may not  have  parameters

5) It  can  not  be  friend  to  any  other  class
    i.e.  friend  function  exists   but  not  friend  constructor
