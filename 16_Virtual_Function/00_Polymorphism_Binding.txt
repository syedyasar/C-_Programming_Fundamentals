Polymorphism
------------------------
1) When  same   function  is  behaving   differently  in  parent   and  child   classes,  It  is  known  as  Polymorphism

2) f1  function  of   parent  class  does  an  operation  and
    same  f1  function  of  child  class  does  a   different  operation.
    This  is  known  as  polymorphism

Types  of   Polymorphism
-----------------------------------------
1) Compile  Time  Polymorphism
    a) Function  Overloading
    b) Operator  Overloading

2) Runtime  Polymorphism
    a) Dynamic Binding  and Virtual Function

Binding
-------------
1) Every  function  is  in  memory  at  an  address

2) Address  of  the  function  is  substituted  whereever  function  is  called.

3) This  is  called  Linking  or  Binding  and  it  is  done by  linker

4) Let  f1  function  be  in  memory  at  addess  1000  and  1000  is  substituted  whereever  f1  function  is
    called.
    Eg :   f1();    ---->  1000

5) It  is  linker  which  substitutes  address  1000  and  OS  branches  to  memory  address  1000  and
     executes   f1    function

6) Called  function  address  is  substituted  in  calling  function.  In  otherwords,  called  function  is   linked
     to  calling  fucntion

Types  of  Binding
------------------------------
1) Static  Binding  (or)  Early  Binding

2) Dynamic  Binding  (or)  Late  Binding

		Static  Binding										         Dynamic  Binding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Binding  is  made  at   compile  time						1) Binding  is  made  at  run time

2) Static  binding  is  made  for  normal  functions			2) Dynamic  binding is  made  for  virtual  functions

3) Normal  function  is  called  wrt  object  (or)  pointer     3) Virtual  function  is  called  through  pointer
    Eg: obj . function();									    Eg : ptr -> function()
          ptr -> function();

4) Type  of object  or  pointer  plays  a  keyrole  in		    4) Where  pointer  points  plays  a key role in  execution
    execution  of  function                                        function

5) Function  execution  is  fast  becoz  binding  is  already	5) Function  execution is  slow  becoz  binding  is  yet
    made  at  compile  time								           to  be  made
