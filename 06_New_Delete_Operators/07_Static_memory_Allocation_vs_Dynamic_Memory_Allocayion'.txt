		Static  Memory  Allocation(SMA)							Dynamic  Memory  Allocation(DMA)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Memory  is  allocated  at  compile  time					1) Memory  is  allocated  at   run  time

2) Declarations  statements  perform SMA					2) new  operator  does  DMA

3) int  x;												        3)  new  int , new  int[5] and  new  int *   create  variable ,
    int  a[5];												     array  and  pointer  at  runtime
    int  *p;
    Variable , array  and  pointer  are  created at  compile
    time

4) Memory  is  allocated  from  stack							4) Memory  is  allocated  from  heap

5) Compile  time  entities  have  names						5) Runtime entities  are  nameless

6) Compile  time  entities  are  lost  after block				6) delete  operator  is  used  to  delete  runtime entities
    terminates
