friend  function
-------------------------
1) NMF  can  use  private  members  of  a  class  provided  it  is  friend  to  the  class

2)  friend is a keyword

3) friend function has no scope i.e. neither  private nor  public

4) Hence  it  can  be declared  inside  the  class under  private  or  public  scope

5) It  is  not  called  wrt  object  becoz  it  is  NMF

6) A  function  can  be  friend  to   multiple  classes

7) MF  of  a   class   can  be  friend  to   a  different  class

8) friend  function  must be  discouraged  becoz  data  hiding  is  lost

9) Using  friend   function  is  not  a  good  idea
