Access  modifier
---------------------------
There  are  3  scopes  in  a  class.
1)  private
2)  protected
3)  public

private
------------
1)  class  parent
     {
           private:
		  int  x;  ----->  'x'  is  private  data  member
	          void  f1()  --->  f1  is  private  function
	          {
	          }
     };

2) private  members  are  visible  to  same  class  and  hidden  from  every  other  class  including      child  class.

3) They  are  also  hidden  from  NMF's

4) A  class  can  not  use  private  members  of  a  different  class  directly.

5) Similarly, NMF  can  not  use  private  members  directly

6) However  private  members  can  be  accessed  indirectly  through    public  function
    i.e. call  public  function  of  a  class    and    it   inturn  uses  private  members  of  same  class.
    This  is  known  as  indirect  access  or  usage

7) private  members  are  inherited  to  child  class  but  child  class  can  not  use  them  directly  becoz   they
    are  not  visible  to  child  class

8) Therefore  child  class  should    call  public  functions  of  parent  class  in  order  to  use  private  members
    of    parent  class  i.e.  indirect  access

9) Data  members  are  usually  private  when  there  is  no  child  class.

10) Advantage  of  private  data  members  is  data  hiding
      i.e.  Contents  of  the  object  is  hidden  from  other  classes  and  NMF's

11) If  object  contains  password,  account  balance  and  so  on,  they  must  be  private


protected
-----------------
1) class  parent
    {
	 protected:
                    int  x;  --->  'x'  is  protected  data  member
	            void   f1()  -->  f1  is  protected    function
	            {
	            }
     };

2) protected    members  are  visible  to   same  class  and  child  classes

3) They  are  hidden  from  other  other  classes  and  NMF's

4) They  are  inherited  to  child  class  and    child  class  can    use  them  directly

5) child  class  can  use  protected    members  of  parent  class  directly

6) Data  members  are  usually  protected    when  there  is  a  child  class.

public
-----------
1) class  parent
    {
	  public:
		 int  x;  ---->  'x'  is  public  data  member
	         void  f1()    ---->  f1  is  public  function
	         {
	         }
    };

2) public  members  are  visible  to  all  the  classes

3) They  are  not    hidden  from  any  class  and  function
    i.e.  They  are  exposed  to  all  the  classes  and  functions

4) public      members  are  inherited  to  child  class  and    child  class  can    use  them    directly.

5) functions  are  usually  public  so  that  they  can  be  called  by  other  classes  and  NMF

6) Hide  data  but  not  functions

Note  :
class    c1
{
}
class  c2  :  public  c1
{
}
class  c3
{
}
main()
{
}

1) private  members  of  class  c1  can  be  used  by  c1  class  only

2) protected   members  of  class  c1  can  be  used  by  classes  c1 and  c2  but  not  by  c3  and  main

3) public  members  of  class  c1  can  be  used  by  classes  c1 , c2  , c3  and  main  function
