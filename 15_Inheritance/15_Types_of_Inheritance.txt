Types  of  inheritance
------------------------------------
1) Simple or  Single    Inheritance

2) Multilevel  Inheritance

3) Multiple  Inheritance

4) Hybrid  inheritance

5) Hierarchial  Inheritance

6) Multipath  Inheritance

Simple  or  Single    Inheritance
----------------------------------------------------
1)  class  c1
     {
           int  a , b;
     };
     class  c2 :  public  c1
     {
          int  c , d;
     };

2) If  there  is  single  parent  class  and  single  child  class,  it  is  known  as  simple  inheritance.

3) Class  c2  is  derived  from  class  c1
    i.e.  members  of  class  c1  are  inherited  to  c2

4) Members    of  class  c1  are  a  and  b  and    members  of  class  c2  are  a , b , c , d  where  a  and  b  are
    inherited  from   class  c1.

Multilevel  Inheritance
-------------------------------------
1) class  c1
    {
      	int  a , b;
    };
    class  c2  : public  c1
    {
      	int  c , d;
    };
    class  c3 : public  c2
    {
      	int  e , f;
    };
    class  c4  : public  c3
    {
      	int  g , h;
    };

2) If  there  is  more  than  one  level  of  inheritance,  it  is  known  as  multilevel  inheritance.

3) There  are  3  levels
     i.e.  c1  to  c2 , c2  to  c3  and   c3  to  c4.

4) class  c4  is  derived  from  c3 ,  c3   from  c2  and  c2   from  c1.

5) c4's  direct  parent  class  is  c3    and    indirect  parent  classes  are  c2  and  c1.

6) class  c4  contains  members  of  c1 , c2 , c3  and  new  members.

7) class  c1  contains  a , b
    class  c2  contains  a , b , c , d
    class  c3  contains  a , b , c , d , e , f
    class  c4  contains  a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h

8) B  lang  is  extended  to  C  lang,  'C'   is  extended  to  C++   and  C++   is  extended  to  VC++

Multiple  inheritance
-----------------------------------
1) class  c1
    {
         int  a , b;
    };
    class  c2
    {
	 int  c , d;
    };
    class  c3
    {
         int  e , f;
    };
    class  c4 : public c1 , public  c2  , public  c3
    {
          int   g , h;
    };

2) If  a  class  is  derived  from  multiple  classes,  it  is  known  as  multiple  inheritance.

3) class  c4  is  derived  from  classes  c1 , c2  and  c3

4) class  c4  contains  members  of  c1 , c2 , c3  and  new  members.

5) class  c1  contains  a , b
    class  c2  contains  c , d
    class  c3  contains  e , f
    class  c4  contains  a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h

Hybrid  inheritance
--------------------------------
1) class  c1
    {
	int a , b;
    };
    class  c2  : public   c1
    {
	int c , d;
    };
    class  c3
    {
	int e , f;
    };
    class  c4 : public  c2  ,  public  c3
    {
	int g , h;
    };

2) Multilevel  Inheritance  +  Multiple  Inheritance  =  Hybrid  inheritance

3) classes  c1 , c2  and  c4  form  multilevel  inheritance.

4) classes  c2 , c3  and  c4  form  multiple  inheritance.

5) class  c1  contains  a , b
    class  c2  contains  a , b , c , d
    class  c3  contains  e , f
    class  c4  contains  a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h


Hierarchial  inheritance
----------------------------------------
1) class  c1
    {
         int  a , b;
    };
    class  c2  :  public  c1
    {
         int  c , d;
    };
    class  c3 : public  c1
    {
         int  e , f;
    };
    class  c4  : public  c1
    {
         int  g , h;
    };

2) If  multiple  classes  are  derived  from  same  class,  it  is  known  as  Hierarchial  inheritance.
    Eg : classes  c2 , c3  and  c4  are  derived  from  same  class  c1.

3) In  otherwords , if  there  is  more  than  one  child  class,  it  is  known  as  Hierarchical  inheritance.

4) Members  of  class  c1  are  inherited  to  classes  c2 , c3  and  c4

5) class  c1  contains  a , b
    class  c2  contains  a , b , c , d
    class  c3  contains  a , b , e , f
    class  c4  contains  a , b , g , h

6) Hierarchial  inheritance  is  quite  opposite  to  multiple  inheritance
    i.e. There  are  multiple  parent  classes  in  multiple  inheritance   and   multiple  child  classes   in  hierarchial
    inheritance
