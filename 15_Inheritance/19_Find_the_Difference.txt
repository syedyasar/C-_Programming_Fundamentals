What   is  the   difference  between  the  following ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class   c3 :  public  c1  ,  c2  --->  c2   is  private  inheritance
{
};

class   c3  :  public  c1 , public   c2  --->  c2   is  public   inheritance
{
};
